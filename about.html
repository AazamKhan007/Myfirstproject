                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello, I am <span>Aazam Shahid Khan</span>, currently a second-year student pursuing a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) in Computer Science and Engineering at Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti Language University in Lucknow. My journey into the fascinating world of technology began with a keen interest in computers, and now, I am taking my first steps into the realm of web development. While I am relatively new to web development, I am enthusiastic about learning and have already started building my skills in this area. Additionally, I have some knowledge of programming languages like C and C++, where I consider myself to be at an intermediate level. As I continue to explore the ever-evolving field of computer science, I look forward to honing my skills in both web development and programming languages.</p>
